### Hi there...

My name is Matthew Smith and I am a current 4th year student at the University of Queensland where I study a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (Honours) and Mathematics. Here are some more things about me...

- Iâ€™m currently learning Operations Research topics in my maths degree where I use the Gurobi package in Python to optimise real-world problems. In the Engineering side of my degree, I am learning how to use Python for projects that require numerical methods to solve complex problems
- I have strong passion for mathematics and problem solving, and I often tutor university courses in these areas
- I previously lived at Cromwell College (residential college within UQ) for 3 years, where in my 3rd year I became the Students' Association Executive Male Sports Coordinator
- I am originally from Rockhampton (in Queensland), where I completed my schooling
- Outside of my studies, I enjoy playing touch football and golf
- I am also a current student ambassador for the Engineering Faculty at the University of Queensland
